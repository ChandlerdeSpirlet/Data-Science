    "This assignment is due on Canvas by **11:59 PM on Friday January 31**. Your solutions to theoretical questions should be done in Markdown directly below the associated question.  Your solutions to computational questions should include any specified Python code and results as well as written commentary on your conclusions.  Remember that you are encouraged to discuss the problems with your classmates, but **you must write all code and solutions on your own**.\n",

Remember that there is a [reference guide](https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5020/mathjax-basic-tutorial-and-quick-reference) linked on Canvas on writing math in Markdown. **All** of your written commentary, justifications and mathematical work should be in Markdown.\n",
    "- Because you can technically evaluate notebook cells is a non-linear order, it's a good idea to do Kernel $\\rightarrow$ Restart & Run All as a check before submitting your solutions.  That way if we need to run your code you will know that it will work as expected. \n",
    "- It is **bad form** to make your reader interpret numerical output from your code.  If a question asks you to compute some value from the data you should show your code output **AND** write a summary of the results in Markdown directly below your code. \n",

    "The NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory (ESRL) Physical Sciences Division (PSD) conducts scientific research to observe, understand, model, predict, and forecast weather, water, and climate extremes and their impacts. They have a website with publicly available data. One such data set contains monthly snowfall for Boulder dating back to 1889 (https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/boulder/bouldersnow.html). Load ‘Boulder_Snowfall.csv’ from the Canvas page. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Part A:** To start, we need to “clean” our data set. When the amount of snow was nonzero, but too small to be recorded, this data set recorded ‘T’. Replace those instances with zeros. AFTER, you've done that, remove any rows (which correspond to years) with missing data. As a check, if you've cleaned the file correctly, there should be 121 rows remaining. "
